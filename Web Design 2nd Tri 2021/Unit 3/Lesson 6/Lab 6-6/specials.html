      <p>
        Come and join us for 8 days and 7 nights in paradise touring and dancing in Oahu! Your package includes air transportation from Los Angeles or San Francisco, a fragrant lei flower greeting upon arrival in Hawaii and transfers to and from the Airport to the Ohara Waikiki Village Hotel where your luggage will be delivered to your room. We have planned a "hang loose and get acquainted" picnic lunch, a buffet dinner complete with entertainment, and an authentic Hawaiian luau.

        All you need to do to reserve your airfare and room is to send in a deposit of $100 per person as soon as possible as space is limited. Don't pass up on this chance! The balance of $1200 due by February 14. Children (up to the age of 13) traveling with an adult get to stay in the hotel for FREE!
