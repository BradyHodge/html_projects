				You want a part-time job. You want a date. You want to win the student government election. You want a loan from the bank to buy a new car. What does it take to get what you want in these situations? It takes communication savvy! Communication savvy involves influencing people to think and act according to your desires, practicing good human relations skills, and using the English language correctly.
