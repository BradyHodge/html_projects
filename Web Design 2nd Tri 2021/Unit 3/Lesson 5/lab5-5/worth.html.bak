			<p>
			It is easy enough to be pleasant,<br>
			When life flows like a song,<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			But the man worth while is one who will smile,<br>
			When everything goes dead wrong.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,<br>
			Is the smile that shines through tears.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			It is easy enough to be prudent,<br>
			When nothing temps you to stray.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			When without or within no voice or sin,<br>
			Is luring your soul away;<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			But it's only a negative virtue<br>
			Until it is tried by fire.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			And the life that is worth the honor on earth,<br>
			Is the one that resists desire.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,<br>
			Who had no strength for the strife.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			The world's highway is cumbered to-day,<br>
			They make up the sum of life.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			But the virtue that conquers passion,<br>
			And the sorrow that hides in a smile.<br>
			</p>
			<p>			
			It is for these that are worth the homage on earth<br>
			For we find them but once in a while.<br>
			</p>
