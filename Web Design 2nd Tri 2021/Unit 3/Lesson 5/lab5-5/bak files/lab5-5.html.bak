			<p>
			When you get what you want in your struggle for self<br>
			And the world makes you king for a day,<br>
			Just go to the mirror and look at yourself,<br>
			And see what that man has to say.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			For it isn't your father or mother or wife,<br>
			Who's judgment upon you must pass;<br>
			The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life<br>
			Is the one staring back from the glass.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.<br>
			For he's with you clear up to the end,<br>
			And you've passed the most dangerous, difficult test<br>
			If the man in the glass is your friend.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
			You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years.<br>
			And get pats on the back as you pass,<br>
			But your final reward will be the heartaches and tears<br>
			If you've cheated the name in the glass.<br>
			</p>
