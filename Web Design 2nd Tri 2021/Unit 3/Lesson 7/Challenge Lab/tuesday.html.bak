				Tuesday was named after the red planet, Mars. The Greek, Roman, Germanic, and Norse cultures all named the planet after their God of War. In Roman, Tuesday was "dies Martis", meaning "Day of Mars". The English name originated from the Norse God of War, "Tyr" from Viking mythology which evolved into "Tuesday".
