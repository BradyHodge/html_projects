    <h3>Outdoor Program</h3>
      <p>
        The Diamondback Outdoor Program is a one-of-a-kind student group that aims to instill a love for the outdoors and adventure in its members! The OP also helps learners foster important leadership skills and build confidence. Throughout the school year, we take students rock climbing, hiking, and skiing. We also offer dutch oven cooking classes. Some highlights include field trips to places like Harriman State Park, City of Rocks, Craters of the Moon, and Sun Valley. Even if you have no outdoor experience, we'd love to have you join us! The pandemic has put a pause on our normal trips, but we're hoping to get back out there more this spring!
