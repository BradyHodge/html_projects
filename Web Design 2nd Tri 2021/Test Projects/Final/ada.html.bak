          Lovelace first met Charles Babbage in June 1833, through their mutual friend Mary Somerville. Later that month, Babbage invited Lovelace to see the prototype for his difference engine. She became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Somerville to visit Babbage as often as she could. Babbage was impressed by Lovelace's intellect and analytic skills. He called her "The Enchantress of Number."

          In 1843 she came to translate and annotate an article written by the Italian mathematician and engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea, "Notions sur la machine analytique de Charles Babbage” (1842; “Elements of Charles Babbage’s Analytical Machine”). With the article, she appended a set of notes. Explaining the Analytical Engine's function was a difficult task, as many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment had shown little interest in it. The notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include, in complete detail, a method for calculating a sequence of Bernoulli numbers using the Analytical Engine

Babbage only built a small part of the Analytical Engine, but Lovelace’s efforts have been remembered. Based on this work, Lovelace is now considered by many to be the first computer programmer and her method has been called the world's first computer program. The early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honored.

          After her work with Babbage, Lovelace continued to work on other projects. In 1844, she commented to a friend Woronzow Greig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings "a calculus of the nervous system". She never achieved this, however. Her interest in the brain came from a long-running pre-occupation, inherited from her mother, about her potential madness. As part of her research into this project, she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Crosse in 1844 to learn how to out electrical experiments. In the same year, she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Reichenbach, Researches on Magnetism, but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft.
