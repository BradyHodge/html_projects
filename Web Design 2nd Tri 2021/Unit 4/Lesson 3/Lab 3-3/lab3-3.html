		<h2>Beowulf Blues</h2>
		<p>
			To say that Beowulf was a hero would be an under-statement. Not only did he show love for his hometown, but also for those he fought with.
		</P>
		<p>
			But was his love for his worries really the same towards him? Sure they fought for him and proclaimed their loyalty to him, but could the warrior’s outrageous boasting be the cause of the end of Beowulf?
		</P>
		<p>
			From a report we received yesterday, Beowulf died fighting an oversized dragon while his comrades ran in terror. His name is Enkidu, and he is the rightful heir to the throne. His coronation will be next Wednesday at noon.
		</P>

		<h2>A Sport of a Different Sort</h2>
		<p>
			The Native Anglo-Saxon Association (N.A.S.A) has created a new sport for the teens of Denmark. This new sport involves a catapult and a fresh pack of chicken meat. The point of the game is to load the chicken meat in to the catapult as fast as you can, and then launch it at an opposing enemy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first team to hit the opposing team with 5 fresh packs of chicken meat wins the trophy and is allowed to take the meat back to the hometown.
		</p>
		<p>
			For more information on the rules of this game, please talk to the herot.

		<h2>Today's Riddle in the Middle</h2>
		<p>
			I start my flight at the start of the night,<br>
			I'm higher than a kite with my gleaming light.<br>
			Without me you would be in the dark,<br>
			And Noah couldn't have sailed his big wooden ark.<br>
			I stay here for you so high in the air,<br>
			Try night without that is my dare.<br>
			To live without me would be truly unfair,<br>
			You would need a lot more than your crying prayer.<br>

		<h2>Money Update</h2>
		<p>
			The king has decreed that this next Wednesday our old coins will be changed to a new design. The king exclaimed, “I do not want my kingdom being represented by some bland design on a slice of worthless metal. Our new design will be more precious than any of our previous designs.
