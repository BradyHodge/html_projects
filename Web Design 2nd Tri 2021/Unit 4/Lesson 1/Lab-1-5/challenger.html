          <h2>Shuttle Challenger</h2>
          <p>
            The Shuttle Challenger was the second of NASA's space shuttles. During Challenger's life, it made several Spacelab missions, which was a working libratory carried in the cargo bay of the shuttle. Challenger was destroyed on January 28, 1986 two minutes after it had lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. A seal between the booster rockets failed causing a flame to burn through the large external fuel take resulting in it exploding. The loss of Challenger grounded the remaining shuttle flights for 2 years while investigations and improvements to the shuttles were made.
