          <h2>Shuttle Columbia</h2>
          <p>
            The Shuttle Columbia was the first of the flight worthy space shuttles. It was preceded by the Enterprise which was a prototype model. Columbia made it first flight on April 12, 1981. The commander of the shuttle was John Young, who was also a Gemini and Apollo Astronaut and the ninth person to walk on the moon. Columbia's first four missions were to test the shuttles systems and performance. Columbia's first operational mission was in 1982 when it deployed a satellite into space. The shuttle remained in service until 2003 when it was destroyed on reentry because of damage it sustained to its wing during takeoff.
