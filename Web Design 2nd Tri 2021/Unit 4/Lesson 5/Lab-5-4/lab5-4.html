      After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in the Cold War, a broad contest over the ideologies and allegiances of the nonaligned nations. During this period, space exploration emerged as a major area of contest and became known as the space race. On October 1, 1958, the US Congress and the President of the United States created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA's birth was directly related to the pressures of national defense.

      A full-scale crisis resulted on October 4, 1957 when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite as its IGY entry. This had a "Pearl Harbor" effect on American public opinion, creating an illusion of a technological gap and provided the impetus for increased spending for aerospace endeavors, technical and scientific educational programs, and the chartering of new federal agencies to manage air and space research and development. As a direct result of the Sputnik crisis, NASA began operations on October 1, 1958, of conducting space missions and within months of its creation, and during its first twenty years NASA conducted numerous major programs.
