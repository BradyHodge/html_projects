			One of the decisions you have to make when setting up a website is whether or not to get your own domain name. The most frequent objection about having a top level domain is that it is an unnecessary expense. Yet it does cost you a little more money, but very little. The costs of having a top level domain name is about $15 per year.

			The alternative to having a top level domain name is to have a sub-domain name. A sub-domain is just a directory on another website, but has special URL access. For example www.ieclass.com is a top level domain, however, jones.ieclass.com would be a sub-domain on the IE Class website. Many organizations, including school districts, create sub-domains for their various departments, but ultimately they are all part of the top level domain.
