			Registering a top level domain name should be inexpensive. To level domains such as .com, .net, and .org should cost around $15 per year. There are other domains such as .co that may cost a bit more but that is because they are new and there are many more available domain names available with them. In many cases when you register your domain name the register, or company that you register the name with, will also provide website hosting as well. Many times they will offer free domain name registration when you host your website with them. This may sound like a good idea, but many web designers generally do not register the domain name and host the website with the same company. A web host is very important to your organizations reputation and it is important that the hosting organization provide full time management of the web servers, which may not be the case with a register.

			When registering a domain name you should be careful and read the fine print of the register's terms of service and user agreement. There may be restrictions on moving the domain name to a different register, or in some cases you may not actually own the license to the name. Read everything, especially if having full control of the domain name is important to you or your organization.
