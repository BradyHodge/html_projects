			Currently three quarters of the entire US population are online and over half the world's population. The Internet is a dominate presence in the market for consumers, therefore the professionalism of any business or organization is extremely important. Would you name your business something that includes someone else's business? Most likely not, therefore it is very important that a business or organization establish their own top level domain name.

		<p>
			In addition if you advertise your website in any brochures, flyers, business cards, letter heads, etc., your target market will give your organization much more credibility if you have a top level domain that is easy to remember. A certain percentage of your traffic will come through search engines and other links where the users does not have to type your domain name directly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the vast number of domain names already registered, it is possible that the domain name you want has already been registered by another organization. There are even companies that buy domain names that they think will be needed at some point and offer to sell them at a huge price. There are laws against this practice, known as domain hijacking to protect businesses from losing their domain names to those looking to profit from registering other organization's domain names. A register generally does not want to be part of a domain hijacking dispute so if you own a business and your domain has been registered out from under you, you can generally contact the register and show that you are the legitimate business owner and they will transfer the domain to you. However if the domain was registered before you started the business you generally have not chance to get the name without paying a lot of money for it. The law only protects existing businesses from losing their domain names.
