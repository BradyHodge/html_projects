					The Capitol of Texas has been in six different locations over the course of its history, including Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco, Columbia, Houston, and Austin. In 1837, the Capitol was moved from Houston to its current location in Austin. The original Capitol building burned the Texas Legislature hired a construction company out of Chicago to plan and build the new Capitol building. Payment for the construction of the Capitol was made in the form of land, not cash. Most of the material for the Capitol building came from Texas, including the red marble on the exterior which was excavated just 50 miles from Austin. The Capitol building was completed in 1888, but in the 1990s it was expanded underground nearly doubling the workspace of the building. The Texas State Capitol is the largest of all the states' capitols and it taller than the US Capitol by almost 15 feet.
