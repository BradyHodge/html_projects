				Auguste and Louis Lumiere are considered pioneers in the cinema industry. They are credited with creating the world's first motion pictures and with holding the first public screening, which they did charge admission. Auguste and Louis worked in their fathers photography shop as kids and while doing so developed their interest in cameras and photography technology. After seeing Thomas Edison's peephole Kinetoscope machine in Paris, they were inspired to design a camera which could produce and project motion pictures. Most of the films produced by the Lumiere Brothers was filmed in one continuous shot, usually lasting a few seconds to a minute. The public was fascinated by their films and paid to attend their screenings, yet the brothers were not very optimistic about the future of the motion picture industry saying "the cinema is an invention without any future".
