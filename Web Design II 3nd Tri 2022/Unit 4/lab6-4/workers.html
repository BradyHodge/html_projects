				On December 28, 1895 at the Salon Indien du Grand Cafe in Paris the Lumiere Brothers held the very first public screening in which featured 10 short films, the first of which was the 45 second film "Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory". The film was lacked any plot and in itself was not very interesting, however the public was fascinated by the technology to produce realistic moving photographs. Nothing like it was ever seen before. In 1895, the Lumiere Brothers gathered a cast of approximately 100 and positioned them behind the gates of their factory. As the gates were opened the actors left and dispersed themselves into the street as if they were leave for the day. This simple film changed the world!
