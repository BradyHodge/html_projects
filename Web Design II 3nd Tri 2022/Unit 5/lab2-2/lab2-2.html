              When searching for a job, all the searching and resume writing have one purpose, to obtain a job interview. To be asked to come to a job interview indicates that an employer is interested in you. The purpose of the interview is to determine whether your experience and education equip you for the job, and to evaluate your character, personality, and motivation. The interview is also an opportunity for you to find out about the job and the company.

              The purpose of this site will be to provide you with information that will help you successfully navigate yourself through the interview process and hopefully achieve your ultimate goal of getting the offer. Many young people do not think much about the interview itself, and feel if they show up and answer the questions they should get the job, but that is not necessarily the case. You must be prepared. Often when an interviewer is looking to fill a position, there are several people interviewing for the job so you must make yourself stand out in a positive way to the interviewer if you want to get the job!
