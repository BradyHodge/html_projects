              Interviewers give high marks to interviewees who have good eye contact. Nothing is more annoying than talking with someone who does not look at you. Such behavior suggests that you my be insecure, hiding something, embarrassed, unreliable, or frightened. Poor eye contact could keep you from getting the job.

              The habits you have developed may help or hinder you in your job search. Interviewers are interested in the way you express yourself orally. Do you have a pleasant tone of voice? Do you speak at an understandable and interesting pace? Is your volume appropriate? Do you enunciate clearly? Is your conversation devoid of the expressions “yeah”, “naw”, and “uh-hu”.
