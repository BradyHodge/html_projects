              Before, during, or after the interview, you probably will be asked to complete an application form. The completed form will tell an employer a great deal about you, and it may determine whether you get the job. For example, an employer will notice the legibility of your handwriting, if you have answered all questions carefully and accurately, and if you can follow written directions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before attempting to complete the blanks, read the application carefully so you know what to include in each blank. Your resume will help you complete it quickly and correctly. Recheck the completed form before submitting it to make sure that all of the information requested has been provided. For information requested that is not application, place N/A, for not applicable, in the answer blank.
